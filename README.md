# Chiller — G&D glycol chiller monitoring

Read-only monitoring of a G&D glycol chiller (Carel c.pCO controller, two refrigeration
circuits) at a remote site. A Node.js dashboard (`node:http`, no framework) reads live
data over two interfaces the controller exposes on its Ethernet port and serves it as a
web page + JSON API.

## The chiller and how it works

**The machine.** A G&D Chillers air-cooled packaged glycol chiller at Lolev Beer —
one white cabinet (93.9 W × 48.2 D × 66.4 H in per the install drawing) containing
two independent refrigeration circuits (A and B), the glycol reservoir, both pumps,
and the Carel c.pCO PLC that runs it all and exposes the data this dashboard reads.
Cabinet layout per the install drawings and factory photos: twin louvered doors across
the front with the compressors behind them (two per circuit — the datalogger carries two
state columns per circuit, `Comp1Circ1…`/`Comp2Circ1…`), two full-width condenser coil
faces stacked on the back with the fans inside behind them — the openings start at the
control-box end, and the blank third at the other end carries the auxiliary port — the
control box on the right end, and glycol supply/return connections on the left end.
The page's 3D model approximates this; see below for its geometry and where it still
deviates from the drawings.

### The 3D unit model — geometry and spec comparison

One hand-built three.js scene (module script at the bottom of `dashboard.html`;
a TWEAK MAP comment at the top of that script documents the coordinate system,
landmark coordinates, and every adjustable knob).
1 model unit ≈ 0.391 in: the cabinet is 240 × 170 × 123 units = the drawing's
93.9 W × 66.4 H × 48.2 D in. +z is the front, +x the control-box end.

| Part | Geometry (model units) | Placement |
|------|------------------------|-----------|
| Shell | 240×170×123: glossy-white top/ends, dark bottom, black edge trim; back skin in five pieces leaving two real condenser openings | |
| Base rail | 244×12×127 black box, slightly proud | bottom |
| Doors | 2 × 10 louver slats (93×8×3, tilted .55 rad), black top band + corner posts (all four cabinet corners), 18-wide center post with recessed slots, flat side bezels | front, z +59.5 |
| Badges | 3 G&D-seal medallions (r 7 × 3 cylinders, vendor SVG canvas-mapped onto the front cap) | top of each door + centered on the control-box end just below mid-height (120.5, −14, 0) |
| Compressors | 2 cylinders (r 18 × 39), steel-blue, light up (emissive) while running | behind the louvers, stacked A above B at (60, 20/−44, 36) |
| Control box | 6×53×42 box | right end, upper third, horizontally centered (122, 50, 0) |
| Glycol stubs | 2 cylinders (r 7 × 14), supply above return (per the drawing) | left end, (−124, −14/−37, 15) |
| Reading chips | 8 HTML chips holding every live reading, each pinned to a 3D anchor riding the unit (`chipAnchors`) and reprojected after every render; chips whose anchor faces away dim (`.far`). Pump/flow pills + runtime counters sit in static strips along the scene bottom | glycol out/in at the stubs, demand over the top, reservoir at the filler cap, circuit low sides at the compressors, high sides + fan % at the back zones |
| Reservoir | 70×154×110 gray-steel tank (base rail to top skin, full depth to the back panel) + filler cap (r 5) through the top skin | left third, same end as its stubs, (−75, 4, −2); cap (−105, 87, 30) |
| Condenser zones | 2 see-through mesh screens (148×69, canvas-tiled texture) over real openings in the back skin, stacked A over B, spanning x −40…+108 (hugging the control-box end, per the rear-view drawing); two fans per screen, each 5 curved ring-sector blades on a hub, recessed inside behind it | back, screens z −60, fans z −53 |
| Zone labels | "A"/"B" canvas sprites | beside each fan row |

Live bindings: `tick()` fills the chips by element id exactly as it did when they
were side panels (no data flows through the module — it only positions them), and
via the `unit3d` bridge const the fans spin at the live fan-speed % (100 % =
2.5 rev/s — display calibration, not physics) and the compressor cylinders light
up while their circuit runs. Behavior: 36 s turntable until the first drag stops
it for good, drag to rotate (pitch clamped −30°…80°) — the high-side chips live
on the back, so the turntable (or a drag) tours all readings —
`prefers-reduced-motion` gets a static pose repainted every refresh.

#### Spec comparison (2026-07-12, install drawings + factory photos)

Checked by rotating the rendered model to each reference view (front+right photo,
front+left photo, rear+right-side drawing, left-side+front drawing).

Matches: overall proportions (exactly the drawing's 93.9 × 48.2 × 66.4); twin
louvered doors with black frame, center post, and a round badge per door;
control box on the right end; glycol supply-over-return on the left end, low and
toward the front; black base rail and edge trim; compressors visible through the
louvers.

Known deviations, most significant first:

1. **No auxiliary port** on the model's back panel (drawing: bottom corner of
   the blank third).
2. Cosmetic: base rail lacks the two forklift cutouts; only the right end panel
   carries a seal decal (real: both ends); zone letters A/B don't exist on the
   real unit (kept as a dashboard aid).

Formerly-listed deviations since fixed against the photos: glossy-white
powder-coat finish with black middle column and corner posts (was brushed
steel), real G&D seal medallions on the doors and right end (were plain black
pucks), 10 slats per door with flat side bezels, control box resized to the
photo.

**The glycol loop.** The chiller never touches beer: it chills an inhibited
propylene-glycol/water mix that circulates out to the fermenter and brite-tank
jackets. Warm glycol returns from the process (**in**, reg 69), collects in the
reservoir (temp reg 132, level via web var), is pumped through each circuit's
evaporator, and leaves as chilled supply (**out**, reg 68) held at the cooling
setpoint (CoolSetP, reg 70) — high-20s °F for beer, which is why the loop runs
glycol and not plain water. ΔT (in − out) is how much heat is being removed right
now. Two pumps: the **chiller pump** circulates glycol through the evaporators, the
**process pump** pushes it out to the tanks. A flow switch per circuit (Flow A/B
pills) is a safety: no flow with a compressor running would freeze and burst the
evaporator, so the controller locks the circuit out — that's why those dots go red.

**The refrigeration cycle** (per circuit — this is what the high side / low side
columns on the page mean):

1. **Compressors** (high side) squeeze refrigerant vapor to high pressure and
   temperature — discharge pressure (reg 3/35) and its saturation temperature,
   condensing temp (reg 4/36).
2. **Condenser** — the hot vapor condenses to liquid in the coil as the back-panel
   fans pull ambient air through the cabinet; fan speed (%) modulates to hold
   discharge pressure in range (head-pressure control), so on cold days the fans
   barely turn.
3. **Electronic expansion valve** (EEV position %, driven by a Carel EVD module —
   status reg 28) — high-pressure liquid flashes across the valve to low pressure
   and gets very cold.
4. **Evaporator** (low side) — the cold refrigerant boils in the plate heat
   exchanger, absorbing heat from the glycol: suction pressure (reg 10/42) and
   evaporating temp (reg 11/43) describe this side. The EVD trims the valve to hold
   **suction superheat** (suction temp 9/41 minus evaporating temp = reg 23/55) a
   few degrees positive — too little risks liquid slugging the compressors, too
   much starves the evaporator and wastes capacity.
5. The vapor returns to the compressors and the loop repeats.

**Control.** The c.pCO compares glycol supply temperature to the setpoint, computes
a cooling demand (power request %, reg 1), and stages circuits/compressors to match.
Chiller status (reg 0) is a small enum — 1 Standby, 2 Off—alarm, … 9 Running — shown
as the header dot. Everything here is read-only: setpoints live in HOLDING registers
the dashboard never writes.

## Quick start (dev machine)

The production copy runs on the on-site Pi (below); this is for hacking on it locally:

```sh
# 1. Get on the site network (see Network access below)
#    Connect Teleport in WiFiman, then:
./teleport_split.sh          # sudo; re-run after every Teleport reconnect

# 2. Run the dashboard
npm install        # one-time; installs modbus-serial + uplot + three
npm start          # CHILLER_IP=... PORT=... node chiller_dashboard.js
npm run dev        # same, but auto-restarts when chiller_dashboard.js or dashboard.html change (dev only)
```

|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`        | Minimal Linear-inspired page built around the slowly rotating three.js 3D model of the unit (a full-viewport-width strip; drag to rotate it by hand — the first drag stops the turntable), styled after the real G&D cabinet — glossy-white powder-coat PBR panels with environment reflections, black trim, middle column, corner posts and base rail, twin louvered doors with G&D-seal logo badges (a third seal on the right end), control box on the right end (proportions from the install drawing); four condenser fans spin at their live reported speeds behind the back screens, and the two compressors glimpsed through the front louvers light up while running. **Every live reading is a chip pinned to its component on the model** (see "The 3D unit model" above): glycol out (tinted amber above 30 °F, red above 40 °F — the same bands `slackPayload` uses) + setpoint + supply pressure at the supply stub, in + ΔT at the return stub, cooling demand over the top, reservoir temp at the filler cap, each circuit's low side (suction, evaporating, superheat, EEV) at its compressor, each high side (discharge, condensing, fan %) at its condenser zone on the back — spin the unit to read them; far-side chips dim. Pump/flow status dots and runtime counters run along the scene bottom. Below the model: glycol history chart (6 h/24 h/7 d, °F axis, dashed line = current setpoint — the log has no setpoint column, so no history for it; green strips along the bottom mark when each circuit's compressors were running, A above B) and a raw-register table under a disclosure; re-renders in place every 5 s. A failed refresh dims the data and stamps the header "offline · data N min old" |

| `/api/all` | `{"regs": ..., "web": ...}` combined payload the page's refresh loop uses |

The controller needs ~60 s per `getlog.csv` query (measured), so the backfill fetches 6 h chunks newest-first (each buffered whole, then merged), then polls only the tail every `LOG_POLL_MIN` min (default 5). `X-Log-Loading: 1` header while the backfill runs, which the page shows as an indefinite "backfilling…" indicator |

`CHILLER_IP` overrides the target (default 192.168.1.69); `CHILLER_REGS` the read span
(default 160); `PORT` the listen port (default 8000). Needs Node 18+ (uses native
`fetch`); dependencies are `modbus-serial`, `uplot` and `three`. Auth is deliberately absent —
Cloudflare Access is the intended front when exposed.

Env vars can live in a gitignored `.env` next to the code (`KEY=value` lines, loaded
natively via `process.loadEnvFile()` — no dotenv). The webhook URL belongs there, not
in the repo or shell history.

Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (a Slack Incoming Webhook) and the dashboard also posts the
glycol temps — in/out, setpoint, reservoir — every 10 minutes (`SLACK_EVERY_MIN`
overrides), plus once at startup so a bad webhook fails loudly. Glycol-out colors the
message bar: green below 30 °F, red above 40 °F, plain between. A failed Modbus read
posts one warning per outage, then goes quiet until it recovers — except at startup,
where a failed first read is suppressed (a service restart races the chiller still
holding the old process's Modbus socket; warning there is pure noise). Unset = off.

## On-site host (Raspberry Pi)

Since 2026-07-11 the dashboard runs continuously on a Pi on the site LAN — an
ARMv6 (Pi 1/Zero-class) board that was already there running OctoPrint, renamed
`chiller` (so `http://chiller.local` on the site LAN — mDNS is link-local and does
NOT cross the Teleport tunnel; from home, use the Pi's IP). It polls the controller
over the local subnet, so Slack reporting works with no VPN in the loop.

Setup notes, hard-won:

- **Node on armv6l**: official/NodeSource builds don't exist for ARMv6 — use
  [unofficial-builds.nodejs.org](https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org) (v20.19.4,
  `linux-armv6l`). Before extracting into `/usr/local`, **delete the old npm**
  (`sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm`): tar overwrites files but never
  removes stale ones, and leftover nested deps from an ancient npm shadow the new
  ones (`Class extends value undefined is not a constructor`, `Minipass is not a
  constructor`). Verify the tarball before extracting (`tar -tJf … && echo OK`) —
  extraction takes 5–10 quiet minutes on ARMv6; don't interrupt it.
- **Raspbian Buster is EOL**: apt 404s until repointed —
  `sudo sed -i 's|raspbian.raspberrypi.org|legacy.raspbian.org|' /etc/apt/sources.list`
  then `sudo apt update --allow-releaseinfo-change`.
- **systemd service** `/etc/systemd/system/chiller.service`, enabled at boot:

  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Chiller dashboard
  After=network-online.target
  Wants=network-online.target

  [Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/chiller
  Environment=CHILLER_IP=192.168.1.69
  Environment=PORT=80
  AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
  EnvironmentFile=-/home/pi/chiller/.env
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node chiller_dashboard.js
  Restart=always
  User=pi

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

  `AmbientCapabilities` is what lets a non-root unit bind port 80. OctoPi's
  haproxy previously owned :80 (proxying the OctoPrint UI) — it's disabled
  (`systemctl disable --now haproxy`); re-enable it and drop the two port lines
  to get OctoPrint's UI back.
- **Deploy loop**: commit+push here, then on the Pi
  `cd ~/chiller && git pull && sudo systemctl restart chiller`
  (`npm install` first only if `package.json` changed).
- **Debugging**: `journalctl -u chiller -n 30` for crashes;
  `curl -s localhost/api | head -c 60` proves the Modbus path end-to-end.

## How the two data sources work

**Modbus TCP (FC4 input registers).** The PLC program maps internal strategy variables
onto INPUT registers 0..~158. Analog values are signed int16 stored ×10 (one decimal:
raw 2448 = 244.8 psi; negatives wrap, `scale()` handles both). Integer registers
(status enums, power %, hour counters) are NOT scaled. Reads are chunked ≤100 regs
because Modbus caps a single read at 125. HOLDING registers hold setpoints (CoolSetP
at HOLDING@1); the dashboard only reads.

**HTTP `getvar.csv`.** The Carel microwebsite exposes every PLC variable —
`name,id,desc,type,access,val` — at `http://<ip>/getvar.csv` (~4000 rows, ~5 s,
gzipped). Filtering is exact-name only, but the `name` param repeats:
`getvar.csv?name=A&name=B` returns just those rows in ~150 ms. That's how the
dashboard gets the points missing from the TCP map (`WEB_VARS` → `read_web()`).
Values arrive in engineering units — no ×10. The `id` column is the internal PLC
variable index, NOT a Modbus address (tested: registers at those addresses are zero).

**Onboard datalogger (`getlog.csv`).** The controller runs one log, `GandDLog04162024`
(id 0, defined in G&D's application via c.design; not editable from the webkit).
It samples 24 points every 5 s — glycol in/out/supply temps, suction temps, all
pressures, comp/fan states, flow — in **metric units** (°C, bar), unlike the ×10-°F
Modbus map. `getlogids.csv` lists logs; `getlog.csv?id=0&start=…&stop=…`
(`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`) exports CSV. Quirk: rows are stamped `+00:00` but the clock
runs site-local time — the dashboard parses them as local wall-clock. The log sat
dead from a 2026-04-15 service visit (`Stop` event) until 2026-07-11: visiting the
controller's system menu (hold Alarm+Enter 3 s on the pGD or the `/pgd/index.htm`
virtual display) → LOGGER re-armed it, even though RESTART LOGS claimed "no logs to
restart". If the chart goes flat, check for a new `Stop` event and repeat that.
The controller also charts this log itself at `http://<ip>/logger.htm`.

## Register map (confirmed 2026-07-04, chiller running)

Layout: circuit 1 at 0–28, circuit 2 mirrors it at 32–56, glycol block at 68/69/132,
hour counters from 131. Full map lives in `LABELS` in `chiller_dashboard.js`:

| INPUT reg | Point                              | reg | Point (circuit 2 mirror)    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----|------------------------------|
| 0         | Chiller status (int enum)         |     |                              |
| 1         | Power request (tenths of %)       | 2   | Power running circ 1         |
| 3         | Discharge pressure c1 (psi)       | 35  | Discharge pressure c2        |
| 4         | Condensing temp c1 (°F)           | 36  | Condensing temp c2           |
| 9         | Suction temp c1 (°F)              | 41  | Suction temp c2              |
| 10        | Suction pressure c1 (psi)         | 42  | Suction pressure c2          |
| 11        | Evaporating temp c1 (°F)          | 43  | Evaporating temp c2          |
| 23        | Suction superheat c1              | 55  | Suction superheat c2         |
| 24        | Discharge superheat c1 †          | 56  | Discharge superheat c2 †     |
| 28        | EVD valve status c1 (int)         |     |                              |
| 68 / 69   | Glycol outlet / inlet (°F)        | 132 | Glycol reservoir temp (°F)   |
| 70        | Cooling setpoint (°F)             |     |                              |
| 131 / 135 / 141 / 158 | Working hours: user pump 2, comp 1 c1, comp 1 c2, source fan 1 c1 | | |

† reads ≈ −86: the controller's own sentinel (no discharge temp probes fitted) —
its web UI shows the same.

**Web-only points** (`Modbus_FB.*` — the block feeds the serial BMS port and is absent
from the TCP map): fan speed A/B %, EEV position A/B %, glycol supply pressure,
reservoir level, chiller/process pump status, glycol flow A/B, compressor A/B status.

## How the map was found (`correlate_registers.py`)

Single-snapshot value matching is unreliable — different sensors routinely read the
same value at one instant (four of the old labels were wrong that way). The correlator
instead samples `getvar.csv` and a register dump together, repeatedly, while the
chiller runs: a register earns a variable's label only if it tracks that variable's
value (REAL: |var×10 − raw| ≤ 2; ints exact) across **every** sample. Drifting values
make coincidences die within a few rounds. This is the one remaining Python script (a
one-off discovery tool; its result is already baked into `LABELS`). Re-run anytime with
a Python venv that has `pymodbus`:

```sh
./.venv/bin/python correlate_registers.py     # ROUNDS/INTERVAL/CHILLER_IP env-tunable
```

Fast-oscillating points (fan, EEV) can't survive the ~2 s skew between the two fetches
— absence from the correlator's output plus absence from a full 0–1999 dump search
(×10 and IEEE-float encodings) is how they were proven off-map, not just unfound.

## Network access

The site is only reachable via Ubiquiti Teleport (WiFiman), which is hardcoded
full-tunnel: it installs `0/1` + `128.0/1` half-range routes that swallow the default
route, killing Claude's API access (and general egress) while connected. It does NOT
touch DNS, and it pins its own link to the site via a host route — both verified by
diag capture.

**`teleport_split.sh`** exploits that: after Teleport connects, it deletes the two
half-range routes and adds `192.168.1.0/24` via the tunnel interface. Internet flows
direct again; only chiller traffic uses the VPN. WiFiman reinstalls its routes on every
reconnect, so re-run the script each time.

### Teleport tunnel — anatomy and operation

Teleport is Ubiquiti's zero-config WireGuard VPN (WiFiman app ↔ UniFi gateway). It
NAT-traverses via UI's cloud brokering, which is why it connects through the site's
double NAT that plain WireGuard cannot (no port forward needed).

What connecting actually does on the Mac (verified by diag capture, 2026-07-04):

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Tunnel interface | new `utunN`; client addr on `192.168.2.0/24`, tunnel gateway `192.168.2.1` |
| `0/1` + `128.0/1` routes → `utunN` | the full-tunnel mechanism: together they cover all IPv4 and are more specific than `default`, which is left untouched — `route get default` still shows en0 (this fooled the first version of the script) |
| Host route `24.3.243.191 → en0` | pins the encrypted transport to the site's public IP via the real interface; this is why deleting the half-range routes doesn't kill the tunnel itself |
| DNS | untouched — resolvers stay on the home interface |

Consequence when connected raw: every packet (including `api.anthropic.com`) is routed
into the tunnel, so Claude/most internet dies while the chiller becomes reachable.

`teleport_split.sh` (run AFTER connecting, needs sudo):
1. Finds the tunnel interface by looking up which `utunN` owns the `0/1` route —
   errors out with "No 0/1 tunnel route found" if Teleport isn't really connected.
2. `route delete 0.0.0.0/1` and `128.0.0.0/1` — internet falls back to the untouched
   `default` via the home LAN.
3. `route add 192.168.1.0/24 -interface utunN` — only the chiller site rides the tunnel.

Routine: connect Teleport in WiFiman → `./teleport_split.sh` → `ping 192.168.1.69`.
Re-run the script after **every** reconnect; WiFiman reinstalls its routes each time.

Troubleshooting:
- Script says "No 0/1 tunnel route found" → Teleport isn't actually passing traffic,
  whatever the WiFiman UI claims. Fully quit WiFiman (menu-bar item too) and reconnect;
  a reboot clears a wedged VPN network-extension.
- Everything dead mid-session → Teleport reconnected on its own and reinstalled the
  half-range routes; just run the script again.
- Check the site itself at [unifi.ui.com](https://unifi.ui.com) (cloud, works without
  VPN) — if the console is offline, nothing on this Mac will help.

### Abandoned: UniFi WireGuard VPN server (reference)

A WireGuard server on the site gateway (port 51830; 51820 taken by Teleport) with a
split-tunnel client conf (`AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.0/24`, DNS line removed) worked on
the client side but can never handshake: the site is double-NATed (UniFi WAN
10.1.10.180 behind a Comcast Business gateway at 10.1.10.1, public IP 24.3.243.191,
not CGNAT) and the required UDP 51830 forward can't be added on the Comcast box.
Revive only if that changes (Comcast Business support can add forwards, or bridge
mode). Client conf: `~/Downloads/Chiller-Tunnel-Chiller-Client.conf` (private key —
keep out of the repo).

### Future

The on-site box now exists (the Pi, above). Remaining step: `cloudflared` +
Cloudflare Access in front of it would remove the VPN requirement entirely for reads.

## Files

- `chiller_dashboard.js` — the dashboard: Modbus reads (`read`, `scale`, `LABELS`),
  web-var reads (`WEB_VARS`, `readWeb`), datalogger cache with disk
  persistence (`readLog`, `logInsert`, `log_cache.csv`), `node:http` routes.
  No framework.
- `dashboard.html` — the page (HTML/CSS/client JS), including the uPlot history
  chart and the three.js unit model (glossy-white PBR, fans spun by the render
  loop at live speed, drag-to-rotate via pointer events);

- `package.json` — declares the three dependencies (`modbus-serial`, `uplot`,
